## How to share your documents
At [conholdate.app](https://conholdate.app) we care about your privacy and understand that some documents might contain sensetive information, that is why we offer differet set of sharing options for you.

### Share document
You can create as many shared links as you want, so in case if you deside to revoke access from someone with whom your already shared a link, this won't be any problem. That is why we advise to create one link per person/site/blog.
1. [Login](https://conholdate.app/signin) to your account or [register](https://conholdate.app/signin) if you do not own one yet. It's FREE!
1. Go to your [dashboard](https://dashboard.conholdate.app).

1. Wait until uploading and processing is complete, then click on <i class="fas fa-link"></i> icon.
1. Select `View` or `Sign` from dropdown menu and click on `Create link` button.

Newly created link will appear in document's sharing dialog.

### One-time link sharing
When it comes to sensitive data and you want to make sure that no one else will see it, except for the person whom it addressed to, use our one-time link service.
One-time link speaks for itself, one-time shared link can be viewed/opened **only once**. After first access, link will return 404 error for all further requests.
